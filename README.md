This Ansible collection allows for easy interaction with an AWX or Ansible Tower server via Ansible roles using the AWX/Tower collection modules.

## Included content

Click the `Content` button to see the list of content included in this collection.

## Installing this collection

You can install the redhat_cop tower_configuration collection with the Ansible Galaxy CLI:

    ansible-galaxy collection install redhat_cop.tower_configuration

You can also include it in a `requirements.yml` file and install it with `ansible-galaxy collection install -r requirements.yml`, using the format:

```yaml
---
collections:
  - name: redhat_cop.tower_configuration
    # If you need a specific version of the collection, you can specify like this:
    # version: ...
```

## Using this collection
Define following vars here, or in tower_configs/tower_auth.yml
tower_hostname: ansible-tower-web-svc-test-project.example.com

You can also specify authentication by a combination of either:

 - tower_hostname, tower_username, tower_password
 - tower_hostname, tower_oauthtoken

The OAuth2 token is the preferred method. You can obtain the token through the prefered tower_token module, or throuhg the 
AWX CLI [login](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible-tower/latest/html/towercli/reference.html#awx-login)
command.

These can be specified via (from highest to lowest precedence):

 - direct role variables as mentioned above
 - environment variables (most useful when running against localhost)
 - a config file path specified by the `tower_config_file` parameter
 - a config file at `~/.tower_cli.cfg`
 - a config file at `/etc/tower/tower_cli.cfg`

Config file syntax looks like this:

```
[general]
host = https://localhost:8043
verify_ssl = true
oauth_token = LEdCpKVKc4znzffcpQL5vLG8oyeku6
```

Tower token module would be invoked with this code:
```yaml
    - name: Create a new token using tower username/password
      awx.awx.tower_token:
        description: 'Creating token to test tower jobs'
        scope: "write"
        state: present
        tower_host: "{{ tower_hostname }}"
        tower_username: "{{ tower_username }}"
        tower_password: "{{ tower_password }}"

```
